twitter_client
==============

Just a Twitter Client I am hacking together in my spare time. It is using Ryan
McGrath's Twython Twitter API Wrapper.

As of right now it only connects to twitter using oauth because that is the only
way to get to connect to twitter's api using the REST API. It pulls down a JSON
file and then tears it apart and puts the data in an array of unicode strings.

I hope to eventually have a lot more working. So I hope you keep an eye on this
and keep me motivated. I encourage people to message me on Twitter @xly15, on
skype at cxly15, and on google+ at Curtiss Wiggins.
